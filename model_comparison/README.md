# Model Comparison

This folder should be a template for comparison. Some models are already implemented and can therefore be compared.

## Usage
For Runtime:
1. Select in [test_config](model_comparison/test_config.py) which models to compare
2. Run [main_runtime_comparison](model_comparison/main_runtime_comparison.py) for a runtime comparison
3. Go to the [plots folder](model_comparison/plots) and look at the results

(You might also want to run the [Thompson comparison](model_comparison/thompson_comparison.py), [recursive update comparison](model_comparison/recursive_comparison.py), [initialization comparison](model_comparison/init_comparison.py) or the [PE predicting strategy comparison](model_comparison/pe_predicting_strategy_comparison.py))
